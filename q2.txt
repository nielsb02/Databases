	Query: "Give the first- and last name, date of birth, nationality and the amount of matches played
	for each player who has not won an award yet".
	
	With this query we would help to remind all young and or not so succesfull players,
	that even one of the best players dont always get awards. 

	We based our query after reading an article on "FourForTwo" with the following quote "sometimes life is just cruel. A combination of bad luck,
 	circumstance and blinding loyalty meant this diamond dozen ended their careers without a single medal on their mantel."
