/*  
We decided to fully outer join the team and club tables, 
this way we now to which club a team belongs and from what country this team is.

Altough most of the team names contain their club names, 
but for example Ado, Az and Utrecht have the same the same team name: "1e elftal".
And if we would add all data of their youth teams the would mostly al have the same team name. 

This gives the query: "To what club does each team belong? In which year was the club established and in what country"

--	We prefferd viewing the query in column mode and with headers on, thats where the dot(.) commands on the first two lines are for (this will be in every query).
