	Query 3: Give the names, date_of_birth and nationality of all players who have only played for the club "AFC Ajax".
	To supporters of the club loyalty of the players to their club is pretty important, 
	supporters are able to see, which player played for the same club his whole carier even in the youth clubs. 
	
	We only added enough data for a maximum of 3 seasons per player, so it is less rare for a player to have played his whole carier (of 3 seasons) for one club.
